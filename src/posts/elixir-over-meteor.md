* Build times are much faster. I’m a ‘code it, save it, check it’ kind of programmer, programming features bit by bit rather than all at once. Meteor rebuilds (on the server especially) take a really long time. On Elixir (with Webpack, in my case), it’s virtually instantaneous, meaning less time to get distracted.

* Pattern matching has saved my bacon on more than one occasion already. Writing GraphQL queries which have different arguments with the premier GraphQL library (http://graphql-elixir.org/) is a cinch. I’m sure I’ll just keep finding uses for that language feature.
